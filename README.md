This is a small tool that I made to convert JPG in Shopify format. 
This tools convert, resize images to match Shopify and other stores' specification like 1800x2600, centered images and white bg.

How to use

Put your pngs/jpgs/webps/etc... into the Input folder!
Use the .bat file: 

Converter - Just convert the images to 1800x2600 jpgs
Scale_S - Resize the images to be 110%, push it below the centered location by 200px & change the resolution to be 1800x2600
Scale_L - Resize the images to be 145%, push it below the centered location by 200px & change the resolution to be 1800x2600
